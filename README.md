First Repository

I am a graduate from UCONN with a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.  I am interested in learning new things and creating new applications.  I have experience with Java, C, C#, Objective-C, and Photoshop/InDesign/After Effects.  I am currently learning git so I can support the community and work with ERP Consulting.
